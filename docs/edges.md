# Edge Reference

Edges define the connections between nodes in a Dippin workflow. They control the flow of execution — which node runs after which, under what conditions, and with what priority.

---

## Edge Syntax

All edges are defined in the `edges` block at the bottom of a workflow:

```dippin
  edges
    A -> B
    B -> C when ctx.outcome = success
    B -> D when ctx.outcome = fail label: "retry" restart: true
```

Each edge is a single line:

```
<FromID> -> <ToID> [when <condition>] [label: <text>] [weight: <int>] [restart: true]
```

## Edge Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `From` | Node ID | Yes | Source node — where the edge originates |
| `To` | Node ID | Yes | Target node — where the edge leads |
| `when` | Condition | No | Boolean guard expression. Edge is only traversed if true at runtime. |
| `label` | String | No | Human-readable text. Displayed on the edge in DOT exports. Also used for human gate choice matching. |
| `weight` | Integer | No | Priority hint. Higher values win when multiple edges are candidates. |
| `restart` | Boolean | No | When `true`, marks this as a back-edge that triggers a loop restart. |

---

## Edge Types

### Unconditional Edges

An edge with no `when` clause is always available:

```dippin
    Start -> Process
    Process -> Done
```

### Conditional Edges

Edges gated on runtime conditions:

```dippin
    Review -> Approve  when ctx.outcome = success
    Review -> Reject   when ctx.outcome = fail
```

At runtime, the engine evaluates conditions and follows the first matching edge. If no conditional edge matches and there's an unconditional edge, that serves as the fallback.

### Labeled Edges

Labels serve dual purpose — display text and human gate routing:

```dippin
    # Display label in DOT visualization:
    Validate -> Fix label: "needs work"

    # Human gate choices (label determines which edge the choice follows):
    Approve -> Ship    label: "yes"
    Approve -> Revise  label: "no"
```

### Weighted Edges

Weight provides a priority hint when multiple edges compete:

```dippin
    Router -> PathA weight: 10
    Router -> PathB weight: 5
    Router -> PathC weight: 1
```

Higher weight = higher priority. If conditions and labels don't resolve the choice, weight breaks the tie.

### Restart Edges (Back-Edges)

Restart edges create controlled loops:

```dippin
    Validate -> Implement when ctx.outcome = fail restart: true
```

When a restart edge is followed:

1. The engine increments the global restart counter
2. If the counter exceeds `max_restarts` (default 5), the pipeline fails
3. The engine clears all nodes downstream of the target from the completed set
4. Retry counts for cleared nodes are reset (fresh budgets)
5. Context is **preserved** — all key-values survive across restarts
6. Execution resumes from the restart target node

Restart edges are **not** counted as cycles by DIP005 validation — they are the intentional mechanism for iteration.

In DOT export, restart edges are styled with dashed lines.

## Routing Priority

When a node completes, the engine selects the next edge using this cascade (first match wins):

| Priority | Mechanism | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Condition match** | First edge whose `when` condition evaluates to true |
| 2 | **Handler preference** | Edge whose label matches the node's `PreferredLabel` from its outcome |
| 3 | **Handler suggestion** | Edge leading to a node in the handler's `SuggestedNextNodes` |
| 4 | **Weight** | Highest `weight` value among remaining edges |
| 5 | **Lexical** | Alphabetically first by target node ID |

This means conditions always take precedence over labels, and labels over weights. The lexical fallback ensures deterministic behavior.

## Condition Expressions

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `=` | Exact string equality | `ctx.outcome = success` |
| `!=` | String inequality | `ctx.outcome != fail` |
| `contains` | Substring match | `ctx.response contains "approved"` |
| `startswith` | Prefix match | `ctx.response startswith "ERROR"` |
| `endswith` | Suffix match | `ctx.filename endswith ".go"` |
| `in` | Value in comma-separated list | `ctx.status in "pass,fail,skip"` |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Precedence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `not` | Logical negation | Highest |
| `and` | Logical AND | Medium |
| `or` | Logical OR | Lowest |

Use parentheses to override precedence:

```dippin
    # Without parens: "not A and B" means "(not A) and B"
    A -> B when not ctx.outcome = fail and ctx.score = high

    # With parens: explicit grouping
    A -> B when (ctx.x = 1 or ctx.y = 2) and ctx.z = 3
```

### Condition AST

Internally, conditions are parsed into an AST (not evaluated as strings). The AST types are:

- `CondCompare` — A single comparison (`variable op value`)
- `CondAnd` — Logical AND of two sub-expressions
- `CondOr` — Logical OR of two sub-expressions
- `CondNot` — Logical negation of a sub-expression

This means typos in variable names can be caught at lint time (DIP106) rather than silently evaluating to empty string.

## Context Variables in Conditions

All variables use explicit namespaces. See [context.md](context.md) for the full reference.

Common variables used in conditions:

| Variable | Set By | Values |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `ctx.outcome` | Agent (auto_status), engine | `"success"`, `"fail"`, `"retry"` |
| `ctx.tool_stdout` | Tool nodes | Command's stdout output |
| `ctx.tool_stderr` | Tool nodes | Command's stderr output |
| `ctx.human_response` | Human nodes | User's text input |
| `ctx.last_response` | Agent nodes | LLM's response text |
| `graph.goal` | Workflow header | The workflow's goal string |

## Routing Patterns

### Binary branch

```dippin
  edges
    Check -> Pass when ctx.outcome = success
    Check -> Fail when ctx.outcome = fail
```

### Branch with fallback

Always include an unconditional edge as a fallback (avoids DIP102 warning):

```dippin
  edges
    Check -> Pass    when ctx.outcome = success
    Check -> Retry   when ctx.outcome = retry
    Check -> Fail    # unconditional fallback
```

### Retry loop

```dippin
  edges
    Implement -> Review
    Review -> Ship       when ctx.outcome = success
    Review -> Implement  when ctx.outcome = fail restart: true
```

### Human choice gate

```dippin
  human Decide
    mode: choice
    default: "approve"

  edges
    Decide -> Approved label: "approve"
    Decide -> Rejected label: "reject"
    Decide -> Deferred label: "defer"
```

### Weighted fallback

```dippin
  edges
    Router -> PreferredPath weight: 10
    Router -> AlternatePath weight: 5
    Router -> LastResort    weight: 1
```

## Validation Rules for Edges

| Code | Rule | Severity |

| DIP101 | Node only reachable via conditional edges may be skipped | Warning |
| DIP102 | Node with conditional outgoing edges has no unconditional fallback | Warning |
| DIP103 | Multiple edges from same node test same variable=value | Warning |
| DIP105 | No guaranteed path from start to exit | Warning |
