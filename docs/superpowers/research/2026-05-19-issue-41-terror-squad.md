# Issue #41 — Terror Squad Findings (parked)

**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Status:** Issue #41 parked at end of brainstorming. Returns in v0.31.0 as a **joint dippin + tracker** release.
**Raw reports:** five reviewer JSONL transcripts under `/tmp/claude-1000/-home-clint-code-2389-dippin-lang/.../tasks/` (ephemeral; consolidate any nuance from there before they age out).

## Why this document exists

Mid-brainstorming for v0.30.0, a five-reviewer panel (language-design / security / IR-API / parser-compiler / future-maintainer) gutted the initial design. Rather than re-discover the same findings the next time #41 is attempted, this doc captures them for the spec writer who picks it up next.

**Do not treat this as a spec.** It is a research artifact. The eventual v0.31.0 spec must make its own decisions — but it must address (or knowingly skip with rationale) every item below.

## The parking decision

The original framing: dippin v0.30.0 ships parser + IR + validator + DOT export + migrate for new `tools:` and `disallowed_tools:` agent-node fields. Tracker untouched until a follow-up. The fields would be a runtime no-op until tracker plumbed them through.

**This is the load-bearing critical finding.** The Security and Future-maintainer reviewers independently concluded that shipping lint-validated, runtime-no-op safety fields is *materially worse* than the status quo: authors get green diagnostics on `tools: none` and ship believing they're sandboxed when they aren't. The project's own track record (v0.22, v0.23) shipped tracker side in the same batch when the language surface had security semantics. Shipping advisory-only contradicts that pattern.

Three coupled scope choices were on the table:

1. **Park #41**, do a smaller v0.30.0 (chosen).
2. Ship narrowed dippin-only with a hard-warn lint on every use of the new fields until tracker lands.
3. Pull tracker into the same batch as a joint release.

Choice 1 was selected. Choice 3 is the natural return path for v0.31.0 — design dippin and tracker together, ship together, no advisory window.

## What blocks unparking

- Approval to design a tracker-side change concurrent with the dippin spec (tracker has been intentionally untouched through v0.28/v0.29/v0.30).
- Time budget for a cross-repo design pass (two specs, two plans, coordinated PRs, joint release).
- Decision on the criticals below (a fresh brainstorming pass for #41 should *start* with this list, not rediscover it).

## Critical findings — every one must be addressed in the v0.31 spec

### 1. Per-node-only misses the bug class

The v0.28.2 incident was an *author-judgment* failure — the author didn't identify the dangerous node. Per-node-only `tools:` requires the same judgment to deploy. A `defaults: tools: read_only` cascade is the only thing that catches "safe by default, opt out per node." DIP28 precedent (`ToolCommandsAllow` in defaults) was specifically chosen for this reason.

### 2. DIP141 reserved-only ships a known typo footgun

`disallowed_tools: bash, applypatch` (lowercase) silently no-ops against tracker's CamelCase catalog (`Bash`, `ApplyPatch`). DIP141 was reserved to catch this but with no firing logic. The v0.29.0 spec explicitly rejected this exact pattern (`route_required: yes` silently parsing as `false`) as "**not acceptable**" when the failure mode silently disables a safety net. Reserving DIP141 contradicts the project's own established precedent.

**Resolutions:**
- Ship `ir.KnownAgentTools = []string{"Read","Write","Edit","ApplyPatch","Glob","GrepSearch","Bash"}` — already implicitly coupled to tracker; making it explicit beats silent failure.
- Case-normalize on parse to canonical CamelCase.
- Or: drop `disallowed_tools` from the surface entirely (see #5 below).

**Sources:** Language Critic C2, Security Threat-Modeler C3, Future-maintainer #6.

### 3. `Params` map is a parallel attack surface

`agent X { tools: none; params: { allowed_tools: Bash, Edit } }` re-enables tools the typed field disabled. Tracker already reads runtime-affecting keys from `Params` (e.g., `permission_mode`). The original design has zero coverage.

**Resolution:** new lint code for known-dangerous param keys (`allowed_tools`, `disallowed_tools`, `tool_choice`, `permission_mode`) shadowing the typed `tools:` field. Extend `agentFirstClassFields` in `validator/lint_response.go` to include the new tool-access fields so DIP133 fires automatically.

**Sources:** Security Threat-Modeler C2.

### 4. Precedence rules between `tools:`, `disallowed_tools:`, `allowed_tools:` are undefined

Five combinations have no spec answer. The issue body itself names `allowed_tools` as a likely future. By the time `allowed_tools` lands, v0.30.0 workflows have already shipped combining `tools:` + `disallowed_tools:` — precedent set by accident.

**Resolution:** lock the precedence rules in the v0.31 spec even if `allowed_tools` is deferred. Suggested order: `tools:` resolves to a starting catalog → `allowed_tools:` intersects → `disallowed_tools:` subtracts.

**Sources:** Language Critic C3, Future-maintainer #2.

### 5. `read_only` doesn't bound the v0.28.2 vector

Chain: agent A (full tools) writes payload to disk → A's `last_response` auto-injects into B's prompt → B (`read_only`) Reads/Globs/Greps the payload file → B's response launders the payload into trusted text → C's prompt receives it → C executes with full tools.

`read_only` is content laundering, not safety. It also exfiltrates `.env`, `~/.ssh/*`, `.git/config` with embedded tokens directly into the 39k-token output.

**Resolutions:**
- Rename `read_only` to `read_filesystem` or `introspect` — makes threat surface obvious.
- Add explicit doc: "`tools: read_only` constrains side effects, not information flow. Use `tools: none` for pure text-in / text-out summarizers."
- Address `${ctx.last_response}` auto-injection at the language level — the runtime auto-injection bypasses the registry filter entirely. Possibly a new `last_response_truncate:` field on agent nodes, or a structural change to context threading.

### 6. `Tools` field name collides with `ToolConfig` and `tool` node kind

`agent.Tools` reads as "downstream tool nodes" — a different concept. Three reviewers flagged this independently. Worst possible name in the package.

**Suggested replacements:**
- Source surface: `tool_access:` (Language Critic), `tool_policy:` (IR Designer), `tools_mode:` (Future-maintainer).
- IR struct field: `LLMTools`, `ToolCatalog`, or `ToolPolicy`.

Future-maintainer also notes: reserve `tools:` as a *name* for a future richer map-shaped field rather than burning it on the enum.

**Sources:** Language Critic I1, IR Designer C1, Future-maintainer closing.

### 7. Fail-open on parse error is the wrong default for a safety field

Invalid `tools: nono` → `cfg.Tools = ""` (full catalog). Author who skips `just check` ships full-catalog nodes labeled with a typo. The proper default for a safety field is fail-closed: invalid value → `cfg.Tools = "none"`. Worth calling out in the spec since current code analogues (`parseInt → 0`, `parseBoolAttr → false`) happen to fail safe-by-luck.

### 8. DIP139-in-parser violates established pattern

Parser has no coded-diagnostic infrastructure today — only untyped freeform strings. DIP127 (invalid human mode), DIP130 (invalid response_format), every other enum-validation lint fires in the **validator** with a `validX` map. Putting DIP139 in the parser is net-new infrastructure not in the spec.

**Resolution:** new `validator/lint_tool_access.go` with `validToolPolicies` map; parser stores `cfg.Tools = val` verbatim; lint emits the coded diagnostic.

**Sources:** IR Designer I6, Parser Engineer C1.

### 9. `DisallowedTools []string` contradicts DIP28's `ToolCommandsAllow string`

Same struct neighborhood, same problem shape, different decision. DIP28's rationale ("tracker owns parsing, IR stays authoring-format-agnostic, avoids drift") still applies to `disallowed_tools`. Two representations of the same concept across two structs is a bug factory.

**Resolutions:**
- Keep both `string` (DIP28's choice — preferred).
- Or change DIP28 to `[]string` in the same PR.
- Or drop `disallowed_tools` from the surface entirely (see below).

**Sources:** IR Designer C2.

### 10. Cross-node coverage holes in `BranchConfig` / `ManagerLoopConfig`

`BranchConfig` (parallel-node branches) and `ManagerLoopConfig` (managed child subgraphs) don't inherit `tools:` from the parent. Parallel agents and managed children have the same v0.28.2 risk profile. Safety primitive with documented holes day-one.

**Resolution:** at minimum an explicit non-goal in the spec; ideally a reserved lint code that fires when a parent's `tools: none|read_only` isn't replicated on children.

**Sources:** IR Designer I3.

## Important findings

| Finding | Sources |
|---|---|
| `tools: all` vs `""` is dead bits — drop `"all"` | Language I2, IR C3, Future #5 |
| DIP140 lints the *least* dangerous combo (belt-and-suspenders); the dangerous combo (`tools: all` + `disallowed_tools: X` opting out of safe defaults) goes unlinted | Security M1 |
| Missing symmetric lint: `tools: read_only` + `disallowed_tools: Read, Glob` makes agent effectively `none` with no diagnostic. This is DIP141's actual home | Language I5, Parser edge case |
| No DOT round-trip parity tests proposed. Security-critical attr survives only by convention. Need `compareAgentConfigs` extension + roundtrip test (matches v0.29.0's `TestRoundtripPreservesToolOutputs` precedent) | Security I3 |
| `disallowed_tools: "Bash, ApplyPatch"` — quotes don't protect commas; single-quotes leak as literal chars | Parser C2 |
| `splitComma` produces empty-string entries on edge inputs — use `splitCommaNoEmpty`; the proposed `parseListAttr` helper is redundant | Parser C3 + I3, IR I4 |
| Casing not normalized — `tools: NONE` silently becomes default-full-catalog | Parser edge case, Security M3 |
| Backend coupling: `tools: none` semantics differ between `backend: native` and `backend: claude-code`. Original spec didn't disambiguate | Security I5 |
| Authoring guidance debt — skill.md would have to hedge ("ineffective until tracker vX") forever | Future #7 |
| `examples/agent_tool_access.dip` must lint-clean; DIP140-tripping example would be permanent CI noise. Mirror the issue body's `ReportFinalStatus` framing | Future #10 |

## Predicted regret (Future-maintainer's closing line)

> *Six months from now: shipped `tools: none` as an authoring surface with no runtime enforcement; no clean way to add deny-by-default-for-unknown-tools without breaking already-shipped workflows whose authors believed the field meant something it didn't. The specific lock-in is the field-name `tools:` — a maximally-generic name that will need to mean something fancier (per-tool config, policy bundles, runtime enforcement levels) within two minors.*

## Suggested starting shape for the v0.31 spec

This is **not** a design — it is a starting point that addresses every critical above. The v0.31 brainstorming should reconsider every choice.

- **Cross-repo scope.** dippin + tracker as a joint release. No advisory window.
- **Field name.** `tool_access:` (source) / `ToolAccess` (IR) — avoids the `tools`/`tool` collision.
- **Surface.** `tool_access: none | read_filesystem | full`. Drop `"all"`, drop `"read_only"` naming. No `disallowed_tools` in the first cut — defer to a richer follow-up if needed (precedent rules already locked).
- **Defaults cascade.** `defaults: tool_access: read_filesystem` works; per-node `tool_access:` overrides (matches `Model`/`Provider` precedent: full override, no merge).
- **Parser.** Stores `cfg.ToolAccess = val` verbatim; no validation. On unknown value, fail closed to `"none"`.
- **Linter.** New `validator/lint_tool_access.go` with `validToolAccess` map. DIP139 fires on invalid value, DIP140 fires when `Params` shadows `tool_access` (`allowed_tools`/`disallowed_tools`/`tool_choice`/`permission_mode` in `params:`), DIP141 fires when parent of a parallel/manager-loop block has restrictive `tool_access` but children don't.
- **Precedence rules.** Locked: `tool_access:` resolves to a starting catalog. Future `allowed_tools:` intersects. Future `disallowed_tools:` subtracts.
- **Tracker side.** Honors `ToolAccess == "none"` by setting `tool_choice: none` (Anthropic) / equivalent (OpenAI). Filter tool registry for `read_filesystem`. System-prompt scrubbing: when `ToolAccess == "none"`, omit the "File tool arguments MUST use..." line.
- **Cross-node injection.** Out of scope for this primitive, but spec should call out the `${ctx.last_response}` auto-injection vector and link to a separate follow-up issue.
