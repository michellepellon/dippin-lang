# Dippin

A language and toolchain for authoring AI pipeline workflows.

Dippin is a domain-specific language that replaces [Graphviz DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) as the authoring format for [Tracker](https://github.com/2389-research/tracker) pipelines. It gives prompts, shell scripts, model configuration, and branching logic first-class syntax — things that DOT forces into escaped string attributes.

## Why Not Just DOT?

DOT is a great graph language. Dippin doesn't replace DOT for visualization — it replaces DOT for *authoring*. The two coexist:

```
Author in Dippin  ──→  Execute with Tracker
                  ──→  Export to DOT for visualization (dippin export-dot)
                  ──→  Render with Graphviz (dot -Tpng)

Legacy DOT files  ──→  Migrate to Dippin (dippin migrate)
                  ──→  Verify parity (dippin validate-migration)
```

**What DOT does well** — and Dippin preserves:
- Graph-native syntax where nodes and edges are first-class
- Graphviz rendering for instant visualization
- A familiar, widely-tooled ecosystem

**What DOT does badly** — and Dippin fixes:

| Problem | DOT | Dippin |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Multi-line prompts | `prompt="line1\nline2\nline3"` | Indented block, no escaping |
| Shell scripts | `tool_command="#!/bin/sh\nset -eu\nif..."` | Real multiline, real syntax |
| Model config | Untyped `llm_model="..."` attribute | Typed `model:` field with validation |
| Branching | `condition="context.x!=y && context.a==b"` | `when ctx.x != "y" and ctx.a == "b"` |
| Validation | Silent — typos in attrs are ignored | 21 diagnostic codes (DIP001–DIP112) |
| Node types | Shape overloading (`box`=agent, `hexagon`=human) | Explicit `agent`, `tool`, `human` keywords |
| Composition | No import/include system | `subgraph` with ref (v2) |

**DOT is still the visualization target.** `dippin export-dot` generates DOT for Graphviz rendering. The migration tool (`dippin migrate`) converts existing DOT pipelines to Dippin with structural parity verification.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

[Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/) is required.

### Install

```sh
go install github.com/2389/dippin/cmd/dippin@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/2389-research/dippin-lang.git
cd dippin-lang
go install ./cmd/dippin/
```

Verify:

```sh
dippin help
```

### Your First Workflow

Create `hello.dip`:

```
workflow Hello
  goal: "Ask the user a question and respond"
  start: Ask
  exit: Respond

  human Ask
    mode: freeform

  agent Respond
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    provider: anthropic
    prompt:
      The user said something. Respond helpfully.

  edges
    Ask -> Respond
```

Validate it:

```sh
$ dippin validate hello.dip
validation passed

$ dippin lint hello.dip
# Clean — no warnings

$ dippin export-dot hello.dip | dot -Tpng -o hello.png
# Generates a Graphviz visualization
```

### Migrate an Existing DOT Pipeline

```sh
# Convert DOT to Dippin
dippin migrate --output pipeline.dip pipeline.dot

# Verify structural equivalence
dippin validate-migration pipeline.dot pipeline.dip

# Check the result
dippin lint pipeline.dip
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dippin parse <file>` | Parse and output IR as JSON |
| `dippin validate <file>` | Structural validation (DIP001–DIP009) |
| `dippin lint <file>` | Validation + semantic warnings (DIP101–DIP112) |
| `dippin fmt [--check] [--write] <file>` | Format to canonical style |
| `dippin export-dot [--rankdir LR] [--prompts] <file>` | Export to Graphviz DOT |
| `dippin migrate [--output <file>] <file.dot>` | Convert DOT to Dippin |
| `dippin validate-migration <old.dot> <new.dip>` | Verify migration parity |
| `dippin simulate [--scenario k=v] [--all-paths] <file>` | Dry-run the execution graph |

**Exit codes:** 0 = ok, 1 = errors found, 2 = usage error.

**Machine-readable output:** Add `--format json` to any command for JSON diagnostics on stderr.

**CI usage:** `dippin fmt --check` exits 1 if the file isn't canonically formatted. `dippin lint` exits 0 even with warnings (only errors cause exit 1).

## Language Reference

The full grammar is specified in [`GRAMMAR.ebnf`](GRAMMAR.ebnf). Here's the practical reference.

### Workflow Structure

Every `.dip` file contains one workflow:

```
workflow <Name>
  goal: "What this pipeline does"
  start: <EntryNodeID>
  exit: <ExitNodeID>

  defaults             # Optional graph-level defaults
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    provider: anthropic
    max_retries: 3
    fidelity: summary:medium

  # Node declarations (any order)
  agent <ID>
    ...
  tool <ID>
    ...
  human <ID>
    ...

  # Edge declarations
  edges
    A -> B
    B -> C when ctx.outcome == "success"
```

### Node Types

**`agent`** — calls an LLM:

```
  agent Analyze
    label: "Deep Analysis"
    model: claude-opus-4-6
    provider: anthropic
    reasoning_effort: high
    fidelity: full:high
    goal_gate: true         # Pipeline fails if this node fails
    auto_status: true       # Parse STATUS: success/fail from response
    max_turns: 10
    prompt:
      Multi-line prompt. No escaping.
      Write markdown, code, anything.
      Reference context: ${ctx.last_response}
```

**`tool`** — runs a shell command:

```
  tool Build
    label: "Build and Test"
    timeout: 60s
    command:
      #!/bin/sh
      set -eu
      go build ./...
      go test ./... 2>&1
      printf 'done'
```

**`human`** — waits for user input:

```
  human Approve
    label: "Human Approval"
    mode: choice          # or "freeform"
    default: approve
```

**`parallel` / `fan_in`** — concurrent execution:

```
  parallel ReviewFan -> ReviewA, ReviewB, ReviewC
  fan_in ReviewJoin <- ReviewA, ReviewB, ReviewC
```

**`subgraph`** — embedded sub-workflow:

```
  subgraph Nested
    ref: other_workflow.dip
```

### Edges and Conditions

```
  edges
    A -> B                                          # Unconditional
    A -> C when ctx.outcome == "fail"               # Conditional
    A -> D when ctx.outcome == "success" and ctx.retries < 3
    A -> B weight: 10                               # Priority weight
    A -> B label: "happy path"                      # Display label
    Retry -> Start restart: true                    # Loop restart
```

**Condition operators:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `contains`, `startswith`, `endswith`.

**Context variables** use dotted namespaces: `ctx.outcome`, `ctx.last_response`, `graph.goal`.

### Multiline Blocks

Any field ending with `:` followed by a newline starts a raw text block. The indented content below is preserved verbatim — no tokenization, no escaping:

```
  agent Writer
    prompt:
      # This markdown header is prompt content, not a Dippin comment
      Write code like this:
      ```python
      print("hello -> world")  # arrows and colons are fine
      ```

  tool Runner
    command:
      #!/bin/bash
      set -euo pipefail
      if [ -f go.mod ]; then
        go test ./... 2>&1 || { echo "failed"; exit 1; }
      fi
```

Shell scripts with `if`/`fi`, here-docs, `case`/`esac`, process substitution, and any other construct work without modification.

### Comments

```
  # Full-line comment
  agent Foo  # Inline comment (must be preceded by whitespace)
```

Comments are not stripped inside multiline blocks — a `#` inside a prompt or command is literal content.

### All Node Fields

| Field | Node types | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `label` | all | Display name |
| `model` | agent | LLM model (overrides default) |
| `provider` | agent | anthropic, openai, gemini |

| `system_prompt` | agent | System prompt (multiline) |
| `reasoning_effort` | agent | low, medium, high |
| `fidelity` | agent | summary:low, summary:medium, summary:high, full:high |
| `goal_gate` | agent | true/false — pipeline fails if this node fails |
| `auto_status` | agent | true/false — parse STATUS: from response |
| `max_turns` | agent | Max LLM conversation turns |
| `command` | tool | Shell command (multiline) |
| `timeout` | tool | Duration (30s, 5m, 1h) |
| `mode` | human | freeform or choice |
| `default` | human | Default choice |
| `ref` | subgraph | Workflow path |
| `retry_policy` | all | standard, aggressive, patient, linear, none |
| `max_retries` | all | Max retry count |
| `retry_target` | all | Node to retry from |
| `fallback_target` | all | Fallback if retries exhausted |
| `reads` | all | Context keys read (advisory, comma-separated) |
| `writes` | all | Context keys written (advisory, comma-separated) |

## Diagnostics

Dippin diagnostics follow the Rust compiler convention: each has a code, severity, source location, explanation, and suggested fix.

```
$ dippin validate broken.dip
error[DIP003]: unknown node reference "InterpretX" in edge
  --> broken.dip:45:5
  = help: did you mean "Interpret"? (declared at line 12)
```

### Errors (DIP001–DIP009)

| Code | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| DIP001 | Missing or undeclared start node |
| DIP002 | Missing or undeclared exit node |
| DIP003 | Edge references unknown node (suggests typo fixes via edit distance) |
| DIP004 | Unreachable node (not connected from start) |
| DIP005 | Unconditional cycle (restart edges are excluded) |
| DIP006 | Exit node has outgoing edges |
| DIP007 | Parallel/fan_in target mismatch |
| DIP008 | Duplicate node ID |
| DIP009 | Duplicate edge |

### Warnings (DIP101–DIP112)

| Code | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| DIP101 | Node only reachable via conditional edges (fragile) |
| DIP102 | Conditional edges with no unconditional fallback |
| DIP103 | Overlapping edge conditions |
| DIP104 | Unbounded retries (no max_retries) |
| DIP106 | Unknown variable namespace in `${...}` |
| DIP107 | Node reads context key no upstream node writes |
| DIP108 | Unknown model or provider name |
| DIP110 | Agent with empty prompt |
| DIP111 | Tool with no timeout |
| DIP112 | I/O data flow — reads key not written upstream |

## Simulation

Dry-run a workflow to see the execution path without calling LLMs or running commands:

```sh
$ dippin simulate examples/ask_and_execute.dip
{"event":"pipeline_start","workflow":"AskAndExecute",...}
{"event":"node_enter","node":"Start","kind":"agent",...}
{"event":"node_exit","node":"Start","status":"success",...}
{"event":"edge_traverse","from":"Start","to":"SetupWorkspace",...}
...
{"event":"pipeline_end","status":"success","nodes_visited":12,...}
```

Explore failure paths:

```sh
$ dippin simulate workflow.dip --scenario outcome=fail
```

Enumerate all possible paths through the graph:

```sh
$ dippin simulate workflow.dip --all-paths
```

## Editor Support

A VS Code extension is available in [`editors/vscode/`](editors/vscode/) providing:
- Syntax highlighting for `.dip` files
- Comment toggling (`Ctrl+/`)
- Indentation-based folding
- Auto-indent after `:`

See the [extension README](editors/vscode/README.md) for installation.

## Examples

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains 15 workflows:

**Production patterns** (migrated from Tracker, with original `.dot` files):

| Example | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| `ask_and_execute` | Multi-model parallel implementation with human approval gate |
| `consensus_task` | Three-model consensus with cross-review |
| `human_gate_showcase` | Human gate patterns (freeform, choice, approval) |
| `megaplan` | Multi-phase sprint planning with orientation, drafting, Q&A |
| `semport` / `semport_thematic` | Semantic porting between codebases |
| `sprint_exec` | Sprint execution with parallel implementation and review |
| `vulnerability_analyzer` | Security analysis with static scanning |

**Stress tests** (parser and validator edge cases):

| Example | What it tests |
|---------|--------------|
| `stress_shell_hell` | Here-docs, `case`/`esac`, process substitution, traps, arrays |
| `stress_prompt_chaos` | Markdown, code blocks, Dippin syntax inside prompts, JSON, regex |
| `stress_graph_monster` | 20 nodes, 4 parallel groups, conditional routing, restart edges |
| `stress_edge_cases` | Every field populated, empty prompts, colons in values |
| `stress_adversarial` | Dippin grammar in prompts, Unicode (CJK/Arabic/emoji), nested here-docs |

## Architecture

```
.dip source ──→ Parser ──→ IR (Workflow) ──→ Validator (DIP001-009)
                                          ──→ Linter (DIP101-112)
                                          ──→ Formatter (canonical .dip)
                                          ──→ DOT Exporter (visualization)
                                          ──→ Simulator (dry-run)

.dot file ─────→ Migrator ──→ IR ──→ .dip source
```

Everything flows through `ir.Workflow` — the canonical intermediate representation. Packages never reach into each other's internals.

| Package | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ir/` | Core types: `Workflow`, `Node`, `Edge`, `Condition` AST, typed `NodeConfig` sealed interface |
| `parser/` | Indentation-aware lexer + recursive-descent parser producing IR |
| `validator/` | 9 structural checks + 12 semantic lint rules |
| `formatter/` | Canonical pretty-printer (idempotent: `format(format(x)) == format(x)`) |
| `export/` | DOT export with shape mapping, condition serialization, restart edge styling |
| `migrate/` | DOT→IR→Dippin converter with namespace prefixing and structural parity checker |
| `simulate/` | Reference graph executor emitting standardized JSONL events |
| `event/` | Canonical event types for the execution protocol |
| `cmd/dippin/` | CLI wiring |

Zero external dependencies. Pure Go standard library.
